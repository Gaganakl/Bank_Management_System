# Bank_Management_System

Java, JavaFX, and MySQL must all be integrated to construct the Bank Management System. The project is set up to show how CRUD operations may be executed with ease, highlighting how crucial it is to preserve data correctness and consistency in a banking setting.

The following technologies are used by the project to accomplish its goals:

JavaFX: JavaFX is used to develop the application's graphical user interface (GUI), which offers a contemporary and user-friendly platform for interaction (Pedersen and Jackson 2019).

MySQL: The selected database management system makes it easier to store, manage, and retrieve information about customers, transactions, services, and branches and staff (Isiaka et al. 2020).
